    "text": "7.1 501(c)(3) foundations\nTo qualify as a 501(c)(3) private foundation, a foundation must exist to advance one of the following exempt purposes:\n\nCharitable, which includes:\n\n“Relief of the poor, the distressed, or the underprivileged;\nAdvancement of religion;\nAdvancement of education or science;\nErection or maintenance of public buildings, monuments, or works;\nLessening the burdens of government;\nLessening neighborhood tensions;\nEliminating prejudice and discrimination;\nDefending human and civil rights secured by law; and\nCombating community deterioration and juvenile delinquency.”\n\nReligious\nEducational\nScientific\nLiterary\nTesting for public safety\nFostering national or international amateur sports competition\nPrevention of cruelty to children or animals1\n\n501(c)(3) foundations indicate which exempt purpose(s) they advance when they file Form 1023 or 1023-EZ to apply for recognition of exemption from federal income tax (aka “tax-exempt status”) (Service 2014, 2020).\n501(c)(3) foundations are either public charities or private foundations.\n\n7.1.1 Public charities\nTo qualify as a 501(c)(3) public charity, rather than a 501(c)(3) private foundation, an organization must be one of the following:\n\nA church, convention of churches, or association of churches\nA school\nA hospital or cooperative hospital service organization\nA medical research organization operated in conjunction with a hospital\nAn organization operated for the benefit of a college or university that is owned or operated by a governmental unit\nA federal, state, or local government or governmental unit\nAn organization that normally receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or from the general public\nA community trust\nAn agricultural research organization operated in conjunction with a land-grant college or university or a non-land-grant college of agriculture\nAn organization that normally receives more than 33 and 1/3% of its support from contributions, membership fees, and gross receipts from activities related to its exempt functions and receives no more than 33 and 1/3 percent of its support from gross investment income and unrelated business taxable income from businesses acquired by the organization after June 30, 1975\nAn organization organized and operated exclusively for testing for public safety\nA 509(a)(3) supporting organization, including the following types:\n\nType I – those operated, supervised, or controlled by the supported organization(s) by giving the supported organization(s) the power to regularly appoint or elect a majority of the directors or trustees of the supporting organization\nType II – those supervised or controlled in connection with the supported organization(s) by having control or management of the supporting organization vested in the same persons that control or manage the supported organization(s)\nType III functionally integrated – those operated in connection with, and functionally integrated with, the supported organization(s)\nType III non-functionally integrated – those operated in connection with the supported organization(s) that are not functionally integrated (Service 2022)\n\n\n501(c)(3) organizations indicate whether they are a public charity or a private foundation when they file Form 1023 or 1023-EZ, and if they are a public charity, they must select the reason they are not a private foundation (Service 2014, 2020). 501(c)(3) public charities also select the reason they are not a private foundation when they file Schedule A (Form 990) every year (Service 2022). Private foundations that later want to be reclassified as public charities must terminate their private foundation status and apply for public charity status.2\nMost 501(c)(3) foundations that qualify for public charity status must file an annual Form 990-N, 990-EZ, or 990.3\n\n\n7.1.2 Private foundations\nThe IRS distinguishes between 3 types of 501(c)(3) private foundations:\n\nPrivate operating foundations use most of their resources to actively conduct their exempt activities.4\nExempt operating foundations are private operating foundations that have been publicly supported for at least 10 years, have governing bodies with less than 25% disqualified individuals and that broadly represent the general public, and have no disqualified individuals as officers.5 “Disqualified individuals” in this case refers to substantial contributors to the foundation; owners of more than 20% of the total combined voting power of a corporation, the profits interest of a partnership, or the beneficial interest of a trust or unincorporated enterprise (if these entities are substantial contributors to the foundation); and family members of any individuals previously described.6\nGrant-making (private nonoperating) foundations are all other private foundations.7\n\n501(c)(3) private foundations indicate whether they are a private operating foundation when they file Form 1023 (Service 2020). This option is not available to Form 1023-EZ filers (Service 2014). Later, private operating foundations that want recognition of exempt private operating foundation status must file Form 8940, Request for Miscellaneous Determination, to obtain a determination letter.8\nPrivate foundations must file an annual Form 990-PF.9\n\n\n7.1.3 Advantages of private operating foundations and exempt operating foundations over grant-making (private nonoperating) foundations\nPrivate operating foundations have the following advantages over grant-making (private nonoperating) foundations:\n\nThey are exempt from the excise tax on failure to distribute income.\nDonors can deduct contributions to these foundations to the extent of 50% of their adjusted gross income, instead of 30%.\nPrivate foundations can make qualifying distributions to them, as long as they are not controlled by said private foundation.10\n\nIn addition, exempt operating foundations have the following advantages over grant-making (private nonoperating) foundations:\n\nThey are exempt from taxes on net investment income.\nPrivate foundations can make grants to them without following expenditure responsibility requirements.11\n\n\n\n7.1.4 Advantages of public charities over private foundations\nThe IRS imposes several taxes, restrictions, and requirements on private foundations that it does not place on public charities:\n\nPrivate foundations must pay excise taxes on their net investment income.\nPrivate foundations must pay excise taxes on acts of self-dealing with disqualified individuals.\nPrivate foundations must distribute a portion of their income annually for charitable purposes.\nPrivate foundations must pay excise taxes on any excess holdings above 20% that it and all of its disqualified individuals have in the voting stock of a business enterprise.\nPrivate foundations must pay excise taxes on jeopardizing investments (i.e., those that jeopardize the carrying out of exempt purposes).\nPrivate foundations must pay excise taxes on expenditures that do not further exempt purposes, such as lobbying.12"
