    "section": "3.2 Margin Text",
    "text": "3.2 Margin Text\n\n3.2.1 Margin Figures\nFigures that you create using code cells can be placed in the margin by using the column: margin code cell option. If the code produces more than one figure, each of the figures will be placed in the margin.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-mtcars\n#| fig-cap: \"MPG vs horsepower, colored by transmission.\"\n#| column: margin\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nmtcars2 &lt;- mtcars\nmtcars2$am &lt;- factor(\n  mtcars$am, labels = c('automatic', 'manual')\n)\nggplot(mtcars2, aes(hp, mpg, color = am)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = \"loess\") +\n  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: MPG vs horsepower, colored by transmission.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Margin Tables\nYou an also place tables in the margin of your document by specifying column: margin.\n\n```{r}\n#| column: margin\n\nknitr::kable(\n  mtcars[1:3, 1:3]\n)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmpg\ncyl\ndisp\n\n\n\n\nMazda RX4\n21.0\n6\n160\n\n\nMazda RX4 Wag\n21.0\n6\n160\n\n\nDatsun 710\n22.8\n4\n108\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Other Content\nYou can also place content in the margin by targeting the margin column using a div with the .column-margin class. For example:\n::: {.column-margin}\nWe know from *the first fundamental theorem of calculus* that for $x$ in $[a, b]$:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}\\left( \\int_{a}^{x} f(u)\\,du\\right)=f(x).$$\n:::\n\n\nWe know from the first fundamental theorem of calculus that for \\(x\\) in \\([a, b]\\):\n\\[\\frac{d}{dx}\\left( \\int_{a}^{x} f(u)\\,du\\right)=f(x).\\]\n\n\n3.2.4 Margin References\nFootnotes and the bibliography typically appear at the end of the document, but you can choose to have them placed in the margin by setting the following option[^1] in the document front matter:\n---\nreference-location: margin\ncitation-location: margin\n---\nWith these options set, footnotes and citations will (respectively) be automatically be placed in the margin of the document rather than the bottom of the page.\nFor example, according to Service (2022) 501(c)(3) organizations indicate which exempt purpose(s) they advance when they file Form 1023 or 1023-EZ to apply for recognition of exemption from federal income tax (aka “tax-exempt status”) (Service 2014, 2020).\n\n———. 2022. “Schedule a (Form 990): Public Charity Status and Public Support.” Washington, DC. https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f990sa.pdf.\n\nService, Internal Revenue. 2014. “Form 1023-EZ: Streamlined Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.” Washington, DC. https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/f1023ez--2014.pdf.\n\n———. 2020. “Form 1023: Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.” Washington, DC. https://www.pay.gov/public/form/preview/pdf/104.\n\n\n3.2.5 Asides\nAsides allow you to place content aside from the content it is placed in. Asides look like footnotes, but do not include the footnote mark (the superscript number). This is a span that has the class aside which places it in the margin without a footnote number.\n[This is a span that has the class aside which places it in the margin without a footnote number.]{.aside}\n\n\n3.2.6 Margin Captions\nFor figures and tables, you may leave the content in the body of the document while placing the caption in the margin of the document. Using cap-location: margin in a code cell or document front matter to control this. For example:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-cap-margin\n#| fig-cap: \"MPG vs horsepower, colored by transmission.\"\n#| cap-location: margin\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nmtcars2 &lt;- mtcars\nmtcars2$am &lt;- factor(\n  mtcars$am, labels = c('automatic', 'manual')\n)\nggplot(mtcars2, aes(hp, mpg, color = am)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = \"loess\") +\n  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')\n```\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: MPG vs horsepower, colored by transmission."

    "text": "7.1 501(c)(3) foundations, trusts, and grant-making organizations\nTo qualify as a 501(c)(3) organization, an organization must exist to advance one of the following exempt purposes:\n\nCharitable, which includes:\n\n“Relief of the poor, the distressed, or the underprivileged;\nAdvancement of religion;\nAdvancement of education or science;\nErection or maintenance of public buildings, monuments, or works;\nLessening the burdens of government;\nLessening neighborhood tensions;\nEliminating prejudice and discrimination;\nDefending human and civil rights secured by law; and\nCombating community deterioration and juvenile delinquency.”\n\nReligious\nEducational\nScientific\nLiterary\nTesting for public safety\nFostering national or international amateur sports competition\nPrevention of cruelty to children or animals1\n\n501(c)(3) organizations indicate which exempt purpose(s) they advance when they file Form 1023 or 1023-EZ to apply for recognition of exemption from federal income tax (aka “tax-exempt status”) (Service 2014, 2020).\n501(c)(3) organizations are either private foundations or public charities.\n\n7.1.1 501(c)(3) private foundations\nThe IRS distinguishes between three types of 501(c)(3) private foundations: private operating foundations, exempt operating foundations, and grant-making (private nonoperating) foundations.\n501(c)(3) private foundations indicate whether they are a private operating foundation when they file Form 1023 (Service 2020). This option is not available to Form 1023-EZ filers (Service 2014). Later, private operating foundations that want recognition of exempt private operating foundation status must file Form 8940, Request for Miscellaneous Determination, to obtain a determination letter.2\n501(c)(3) private foundations must file an annual Form 990-PF.3\n\n7.1.1.1 501(c)(3) private: private operating foundation (IRS status) & corporate foundation (NTEE code)\nPrivate operating foundations (IRS status) use most of their resources to actively conduct their exempt activities.4\nCorporate foundations (NTEE code) are “private foundations whose grant funds are derived primarily from the contributions of a profit-making business organization.”5\nWe can identify 501(c)(3) private operating foundations (IRS status) that are also corporate foundations (NTEE code) using SUBSECCD (subsection code), FNDNCD (reason for 501(c)(3) status) and NTEECC (NTEECC primary purpose). Values of 3 for SUBSECCD indicate that an organization is a 501(c)(3) organization; values of 3 for FNDNCD indicate that an organization is a 501(c)(3) private operating foundation (IRS status), and values of T21 for NTEECC indicate that an organization is a corporate foundation (NTEE code).\n\n\n7.1.1.2 501(c)(3) private: exempt operating foundation (IRS status) & corporate foundation (NTEE code)\nExempt operating foundations (IRS status) are private operating foundations that have been publicly supported for at least 10 years, have governing bodies with less than 25% disqualified individuals and that broadly represent the general public, and have no disqualified individuals as officers.6 “Disqualified individuals” in this case refers to substantial contributors to the foundation; owners of more than 20% of the total combined voting power of a corporation, the profits interest of a partnership, or the beneficial interest of a trust or unincorporated enterprise (if these entities are substantial contributors to the foundation); and family members of any individuals previously described.7\nCorporate foundations (NTEE code) are “private foundations whose grant funds are derived primarily from the contributions of a profit-making business organization.”8\nWe can identify 501(c)(3) exempt operating foundations (IRS status) that are also corporate foundations (NTEE code) using SUBSECCD (subsection code), FNDNCD (reason for 501(c)(3) status) and NTEECC (NTEECC primary purpose). Values of 3 for SUBSECCD indicate that an organization is a 501(c)(3) organization; values of 2 for FNDNCD indicate that an organization is a 501(c)(3) exempt operating foundation (IRS status), and values of T21 for NTEECC indicate that an organization is a corporate foundation (NTEE code).\n\n\n7.1.1.3 501(c)(3) private: grant-making (private nonoperating) foundation (IRS status) & corporate foundation (NTEE code)\nGrant-making (private nonoperating) foundations (IRS status) are all other private foundations.9\nPrivate operating foundations have the following advantages over grant-making (private nonoperating) foundations:\n\nThey are exempt from the excise tax on failure to distribute income.\nDonors can deduct contributions to these foundations to the extent of 50% of their adjusted gross income, instead of 30%.\nPrivate foundations can make qualifying distributions to them, as long as they are not controlled by said private foundation.10\n\nIn addition, exempt operating foundations have the following advantages over grant-making (private nonoperating) foundations:\n\nThey are exempt from taxes on net investment income.\nPrivate foundations can make grants to them without following expenditure responsibility requirements.11\n\nCorporate foundations (NTEE code) are “private foundations whose grant funds are derived primarily from the contributions of a profit-making business organization.”12\nWe can identify 501(c)(3) grant-making (private nonoperating) foundations (IRS status) that are also corporate foundations (NTEE code) using SUBSECCD (subsection code), FNDNCD (reason for 501(c)(3) status) and NTEECC (NTEECC primary purpose).
