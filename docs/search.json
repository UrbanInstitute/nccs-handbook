This option is not available to Form 1023-EZ filers (Service 2014). Later, private operating foundations that want recognition of exempt private operating foundation status must file Form 8940, Request for Miscellaneous Determination, to obtain a determination letter.2\n501(c)(3) private foundations must file an annual Form 990-PF.3\n\n7.1.1.1 501(c)(3) private: private operating foundation (IRS status) & corporate foundation (NTEE code)\nPrivate operating foundations (IRS status) use most of their resources to actively conduct their exempt activities.4\nCorporate foundations (NTEE code) are “private foundations whose grant funds are derived primarily from the contributions of a profit-making business organization.”5\nWe can identify 501(c)(3) private operating foundations (IRS status) that are also corporate foundations (NTEE code) using SUBSECCD (subsection code), FNDNCD (reason for 501(c)(3) status) and NTEECC (NTEECC primary purpose). Values of 3 for SUBSECCD indicate that an organization is a 501(c)(3) organization; values of 3 for FNDNCD indicate that an organization is a 501(c)(3) private operating foundation (IRS status), and values of T21 for NTEECC indicate that an organization is a corporate foundation (NTEE code).\n\n\n7.1.1.2 501(c)(3) private: exempt operating foundation (IRS status) & corporate foundation (NTEE code)\nExempt operating foundations (IRS status) are private operating foundations that have been publicly supported for at least 10 years, have governing bodies with less than 25% disqualified individuals and that broadly represent the general public, and have no disqualified individuals as officers.6 “Disqualified individuals” in this case refers to substantial contributors to the foundation; owners of more than 20% of the total combined voting power of a corporation, the profits interest of a partnership, or the beneficial interest of a trust or unincorporated enterprise (if these entities are substantial contributors to the foundation); and family members of any individuals previously described.7\nCorporate foundations (NTEE code) are “private foundations whose grant funds are derived primarily from the contributions of a profit-making business organization.”8\nWe can identify 501(c)(3) exempt operating foundations (IRS status) that are also corporate foundations (NTEE code) using SUBSECCD (subsection code), FNDNCD (reason for 501(c)(3) status) and NTEECC (NTEECC primary purpose). Values of 3 for SUBSECCD indicate that an organization is a 501(c)(3) organization; values of 2 for FNDNCD indicate that an organization is a 501(c)(3) exempt operating foundation (IRS status), and values of T21 for NTEECC indicate that an organization is a corporate foundation (NTEE code).\n\n\n7.1.1.3 501(c)(3) private: grant-making (private nonoperating) foundation (IRS status) & corporate foundation (NTEE code)\nGrant-making (private nonoperating) foundations (IRS status) are all other private foundations.9\nPrivate operating foundations have the following advantages over grant-making (private nonoperating) foundations:\n\nThey are exempt from the excise tax on failure to distribute income.\nDonors can deduct contributions to these foundations to the extent of 50% of their adjusted gross income, instead of 30%.\nPrivate foundations can make qualifying distributions to them, as long as they are not controlled by said private foundation.10\n\nIn addition, exempt operating foundations have the following advantages over grant-making (private nonoperating) foundations:\n\nThey are exempt from taxes on net investment income.\nPrivate foundations can make grants to them without following expenditure responsibility requirements.11\n\nCorporate foundations (NTEE code) are “private foundations whose grant funds are derived primarily from the contributions of a profit-making business organization.”12\nWe can identify 501(c)(3) grant-making (private nonoperating) foundations (IRS status) that are also corporate foundations (NTEE code) using SUBSECCD (subsection code), FNDNCD (reason for 501(c)(3) status) and NTEECC (NTEECC primary purpose).

Because of their endowments, they are focused primarily on grantmaking and generally do not actively raise funds or seek public financial support. These are the most common type of private foundation They are generally endowed, usually from a single individual or family. Private foundations are considered family foundations if relatives or the original donor are still active on the board of trustees or in the operation of the foundation.”14\nWe can identify 501(c)(3) private operating foundations (IRS status) that are also private independent foundations (NTEE code) using SUBSECCD (subsection code), FNDNCD (reason for 501(c)(3) status) and NTEECC (NTEECC primary purpose).
