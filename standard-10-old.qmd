# Foundations, Trusts, and Grant-Making Organizations

This chapter covers foundation types. It explains three variables: FNDNCD (reason for 501(c)(3) status), SUBSECCD (subsection code), and FRCD (filing requirement code).

## 501(c)(3) foundations

To qualify as a 501(c)(3) private foundation, a foundation must exist to advance one of the following exempt purposes:

-   Charitable, which includes:

    -   "Relief of the poor, the distressed, or the underprivileged;

    -   Advancement of religion;

    -   Advancement of education or science;

    -   Erection or maintenance of public buildings, monuments, or works;

    -   Lessening the burdens of government;

    -   Lessening neighborhood tensions;

    -   Eliminating prejudice and discrimination;

    -   Defending human and civil rights secured by law; and

    -   Combating community deterioration and juvenile delinquency."

-   Religious

-   Educational

-   Scientific

-   Literary

-   Testing for public safety

-   Fostering national or international amateur sports competition

-   Prevention of cruelty to children or animals[^standard-10-old-1]

[^standard-10-old-1]: [@irs-exempt-purposes]

501(c)(3) foundations indicate which exempt purpose(s) they advance when they file Form 1023 or 1023-EZ to apply for recognition of exemption from federal income tax (aka "tax-exempt status") [@irs-2014b; @irs-2020a].

501(c)(3) foundations are either public charities or private foundations.

### Public charities

To qualify as a 501(c)(3) public charity, rather than a 501(c)(3) private foundation, an organization must be one of the following:

-   A church, convention of churches, or association of churches

-   A school

-   A hospital or cooperative hospital service organization

-   A medical research organization operated in conjunction with a hospital

-   An organization operated for the benefit of a college or university that is owned or operated by a governmental unit

-   A federal, state, or local government or governmental unit

-   An organization that normally receives a substantial part of its support from a governmental unit or from the general public

-   A community trust

-   An agricultural research organization operated in conjunction with a land-grant college or university or a non-land-grant college of agriculture

-   An organization that normally receives more than 33 and 1/3% of its support from contributions, membership fees, and gross receipts from activities related to its exempt functions and receives no more than 33 and 1/3 percent of its support from gross investment income and unrelated business taxable income from businesses acquired by the organization after June 30, 1975

-   An organization organized and operated exclusively for testing for public safety

-   A 509(a)(3) supporting organization, including the following types:

    -   Type I -- those operated, supervised, or controlled by the supported organization(s) by giving the supported organization(s) the power to regularly appoint or elect a majority of the directors or trustees of the supporting organization

    -   Type II -- those supervised or controlled in connection with the supported organization(s) by having control or management of the supporting organization vested in the same persons that control or manage the supported organization(s)

    -   Type III functionally integrated -- those operated in connection with, and functionally integrated with, the supported organization(s)

    -   Type III non-functionally integrated -- those operated in connection with the supported organization(s) that are not functionally integrated [@irs-2022f]

501(c)(3) organizations indicate whether they are a public charity or a private foundation when they file Form 1023 or 1023-EZ, and if they are a public charity, they must select the reason they are not a private foundation [@irs-2014b; @irs-2020a]. 501(c)(3) public charities also select the reason they are not a private foundation when they file Schedule A (Form 990) every year [@irs-2022f]. Private foundations that later want to be reclassified as public charities must terminate their private foundation status and apply for public charity status.[^standard-10-old-2]

[^standard-10-old-2]: [@irs-instructions-8940]

Most 501(c)(3) foundations that qualify for public charity status must file an annual Form 990-N, 990-EZ, or 990.[^standard-10-old-3]

[^standard-10-old-3]: [@irs-who-must-file]

### Private foundations

The IRS distinguishes between 3 types of 501(c)(3) private foundations:

1.  **Private operating foundations** use most of their resources to actively conduct their exempt activities.[^standard-10-old-4]
2.  **Exempt operating foundations** are private operating foundations that have been publicly supported for at least 10 years, have governing bodies with less than 25% disqualified individuals and that broadly represent the general public, and have no disqualified individuals as officers.[^standard-10-old-5] "Disqualified individuals" in this case refers to substantial contributors to the foundation; owners of more than 20% of the total combined voting power of a corporation, the profits interest of a partnership, or the beneficial interest of a trust or unincorporated enterprise (if these entities are substantial contributors to the foundation); and family members of any individuals previously described.[^standard-10-old-6]
3.  **Grant-making (private nonoperating) foundations** are all other private foundations.[^standard-10-old-7]

[^standard-10-old-4]: [@irs-private-op]

[^standard-10-old-5]: [@irs-exempt-op]

[^standard-10-old-6]: [@irs-disqualified]

[^standard-10-old-7]: [@irs-grantmaking]

501(c)(3) private foundations indicate whether they are a private operating foundation when they file Form 1023 [@irs-2020a]. This option is not available to Form 1023-EZ filers [@irs-2014b]. Later, private operating foundations that want recognition of exempt private operating foundation status must file Form 8940, Request for Miscellaneous Determination, to obtain a determination letter.[^standard-10-old-8]

[^standard-10-old-8]: [@irs-def-of-exempt-op]

Private foundations must file an annual Form 990-PF.[^standard-10-old-9]

[^standard-10-old-9]: [@irs-990pf-instructions]

### Advantages of private operating foundations and exempt operating foundations over grant-making (private nonoperating) foundations

Private operating foundations have the following advantages over grant-making (private nonoperating) foundations:

-   They are exempt from the excise tax on failure to distribute income.
-   Donors can deduct contributions to these foundations to the extent of 50% of their adjusted gross income, instead of 30%.
-   Private foundations can make qualifying distributions to them, as long as they are not controlled by said private foundation.[^standard-10-old-10]

[^standard-10-old-10]: [@irs-private-op]

In addition, *exempt* operating foundations have the following advantages over grant-making (private nonoperating) foundations:

-   They are exempt from taxes on net investment income.
-   Private foundations can make grants to them without following expenditure responsibility requirements.[^standard-10-old-11]

[^standard-10-old-11]: [@irs-exempt-op]

### Advantages of public charities over private foundations

The IRS imposes several taxes, restrictions, and requirements on private foundations that it does not place on public charities:

-   Private foundations must pay excise taxes on their net investment income.

-   Private foundations must pay excise taxes on acts of self-dealing with disqualified individuals.

-   Private foundations must distribute a portion of their income annually for charitable purposes.

-   Private foundations must pay excise taxes on any excess holdings above 20% that it and all of its disqualified individuals have in the voting stock of a business enterprise.

-   Private foundations must pay excise taxes on jeopardizing investments (i.e., those that jeopardize the carrying out of exempt purposes).

-   Private foundations must pay excise taxes on expenditures that do not further exempt purposes, such as lobbying.[^standard-10-old-12]

## 501(c)(17) trusts providing for the payment of supplemental unemployment compensation benefits

An organization must meet the following requirements for to qualify for exemption from federal income tax as a 501(c)(17) trust providing for the payment of supplemental unemployment compensation benefits:

1.  "The trust must constitute a valid trust under local law, be evidenced by an executed written document, and be part of a written plan.

2.  The plan must be established and maintained by an employer or its employees solely for the purpose of providing supplemental unemployment compensation benefits.

3.  The plan must provide that the corpus and income of the trust cannot be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than providing such benefits prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities to the employees covered by the plan.

4.  Benefits must be determined according to objective standards, and may not be determined solely in the discretion of the trustees.

5.  The eligibility requirements and the benefits payable must not discriminate in favor of officers, shareholders, supervisory employees, or highly compensated employees.  Benefits payable under the plan will not be considered discriminatory if they bear a uniform relationship to the total compensation of the employees covered by the plan."[^standard-10-old-13]

[^standard-10-old-13]: [@irs-501c17]

These trusts apply for recognition of exemption from federal income tax by filing Form 1024.[^standard-10-old-14] They must file an annual Form 990-N, 990-EZ, or 990 [@irs-2023c].

[^standard-10-old-14]: [@irs-501c17]

## 501(c)(18) employee funded pension trusts

[^standard-10-old-17]: [@irs-charitable-trusts]

The IRS treats them as private foundations unless they meet one of the requirements for being a public charity.[^standard-10-old-18]

[^standard-10-old-18]: [@irs-charitable-trusts]

4947(a)(1) charitable trusts not treated as private foundations must file an annual Form 990-EZ or 990.[^standard-10-old-19] 4947(a)(1) charitable trusts treated as private foundations must file an annual Form 990-PF.[^standard-10-old-20]

[^standard-10-old-21]: [@irs-split-interest-trust-stats]

[^standard-10-old-22]: [@irs-form-5227]
