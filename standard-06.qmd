A 501(c)(10) organization "devote\[s\] their net earnings exclusively to religious, charitable, scientific, literary, educational, and fraternal purposes" [@irs-501c8-501c10]. These organizations are very similar to 501(c)(8) organizations, except that a 501(c)(10) may not provide insurance to its members. The Masons are the most well known example of a 501(c)(10).

Veterans' Organizations may also be a 501(c)(2), 501(c)(4), 501(c)(7), 501(c)(8), or 501(c)(10) depending on their scope of mission. See @irs-p3386 for more details. Here we summarize the primary differences between these a 501(c)(19) and veterans' organizations in other 501(c) types.

They are often operated in conjunction with 501(c)(4) veterans' organizations. They are required to have a certain percentage of their members be past or present members of the United States Armed Forces.

-   A 501(c)(8) veterans' organization is a fraternal club is a fraternal society.
