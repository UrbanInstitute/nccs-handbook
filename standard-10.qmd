Each type of organization is described in detail below.

## 501(c)(3) foundations, trusts, and grant-making organizations

To qualify as a 501(c)(3) organization, an organization must exist to advance one of the following exempt purposes:

-   Charitable, which includes:

    -   "Relief of the poor, the distressed, or the underprivileged;

    -   Advancement of religion;

    -   Advancement of education or science;

    -   Erection or maintenance of public buildings, monuments, or works;

    -   Lessening the burdens of government;

    -   Lessening neighborhood tensions;

    -   Eliminating prejudice and discrimination;

    -   Defending human and civil rights secured by law; and

    -   Combating community deterioration and juvenile delinquency."

-   Religious

-   Educational

-   Scientific

-   Literary

-   Testing for public safety

-   Fostering national or international amateur sports competition

-   Prevention of cruelty to children or animals[^1]

[^1]: [@irs-exempt-purposes]

501(c)(3) organizations indicate which exempt purpose(s) they advance when they file Form 1023 or 1023-EZ to apply for recognition of exemption from federal income tax (aka "tax-exempt status") [@irs-2014b; @irs-2020a].

501(c)(3) organizations are either private foundations or public charities.

### 501(c)(3) private foundations

The IRS distinguishes between three types of 501(c)(3) private foundations: private operating foundations, exempt operating foundations, and grant-making (private nonoperating) foundations.

501(c)(3) private foundations indicate whether they are a private operating foundation when they file Form 1023 [@irs-2020a]. This option is not available to Form 1023-EZ filers [@irs-2014b]. Later, private operating foundations that want recognition of exempt private operating foundation status must file Form 8940, Request for Miscellaneous Determination, to obtain a determination letter.[^2]

[^2]: [@irs-def-of-exempt-op]

501(c)(3) private foundations must file an annual Form 990-PF.[^3]

[^3]: [@irs-990pf-instructions]

#### 501(c)(3) private foundation: private operating foundation (IRS status) & corporate foundation (NTEE code)

Private operating foundations (IRS status) use most of their resources to actively conduct their exempt activities.[^4]

[^4]: [@irs-private-op]

Corporate foundations (NTEE code) are "private foundations whose grant funds are derived primarily from the contributions of a profit-making business organization."[^5]

[^5]: [@activity-codes]

We can identify 501(c)(3) private operating foundations (IRS status) that are also corporate foundations (NTEE code) using FNDNCD (reason for 501(c)(3) status) and NTEECC (NTEECC primary purpose). Values of 3 for FNDNCD indicate that an organization is a 501(c)(3) private operating foundation (IRS status), and values of T21 for NTEECC indicate that an organization is a corporate foundation (NTEE code).

#### 501(c)(3) private foundation: private operating foundation (IRS status) & private independent foundation (NTEE code)

Private operating foundations (IRS status) use most of their resources to actively conduct their exempt activities.[^6]

[^6]: [@irs-private-op]

Private independent foundations (NTEE code) are "private foundations that make grants based on charitable endowments. Because of their endowments, they are focused primarily on grantmaking and generally do not actively raise funds or seek public financial support. These are the most common type of private foundation They are generally endowed, usually from a single individual or family. Private foundations are considered family foundations if relatives or the original donor are still active on the board of trustees or in the operation of the foundation."[^7]

[^7]: [@activity-codes]

We can identify 501(c)(3) private operating foundations (IRS status) that are also private independent foundations (NTEE code) using FNDNCD (reason for 501(c)(3) status) and NTEECC (NTEECC primary purpose). Values of 3 for FNDNCD indicate that an organization is a 501(c)(3) private operating foundation (IRS status), and values of T22 for NTEECC indicate that an organization is a private independent foundation (NTEE code).

#### 501(c)(3) private foundation: private operating foundation (IRS status) & private operating foundation (NTEE code)

Private operating foundations (IRS status) use most of their resources to actively conduct their exempt activities.[^8]

[^8]: [@irs-private-op]

Private operating foundations (NTEE code) are "private foundations that use a bulk of their resources to provide charitable services or run charitable programs of their own. They make few, if any, grants to outside organizations and, like private independent foundations, they generally do not raise funds from the public."[^9]

[^9]: [@activity-codes]

We can identify 501(c)(3) private operating foundations (IRS status) that are also private operating foundations (NTEE code) using FNDNCD (reason for 501(c)(3) status) and NTEECC (NTEECC primary purpose). Values of 3 for FNDNCD indicate that an organization is a 501(c)(3) private operating foundation (IRS status), and values of T23 for NTEECC indicate that an organization is a private operating foundation (NTEE code).

#### 501(c)(3) private foundation: private operating foundation (IRS status), other (NTEE code)

Private operating foundations (IRS status) use most of their resources to actively conduct their exempt activities.[^10]

[^10]: [@irs-private-op]

Values of 3 for FNDNCD indicate that an organization is a 501(c)(3) private operating foundation (IRS status), and values of anything other than T21, T22, and T23 for NTEECC indicate that an organization is not a corporate foundation, private independent foundation, or private operating foundation (NTEE codes).

#### 501(c)(3) private foundation: exempt operating foundation (IRS status) & corporate foundation (NTEE code)

Exempt operating foundations (IRS status) are private operating foundations that have been publicly supported for at least 10 years, have governing bodies with less than 25% disqualified individuals and that broadly represent the general public, and have no disqualified individuals as officers.[^11] "Disqualified individuals" in this case refers to substantial contributors to the foundation; owners of more than 20% of the total combined voting power of a corporation, the profits interest of a partnership, or the beneficial interest of a trust or unincorporated enterprise (if these entities are substantial contributors to the foundation); and family members of any individuals previously described.[^12]
