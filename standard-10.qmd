# Foundations, Trusts, and Grant-Making Organizations

This chapter explains NCCS's taxonomy for foundations, trusts, and grant-making organizations:

\[INSERT TABLE\]

Each type of organization is described in detail below.

## Not a foundation

***Description.*** Organizations in this category are not foundations, trusts, or grant-making organizations.

***Foundation/trust/grant-making organization status.*** Organizations in this category are not foundations, trusts, or grant-making organizations.

***Subsector.*** These organizations can be 501(c)(3) or 501not3 organizations. (See Appendix A for more details about 501(c)(3) vs. 501not3 organizations).

***Public or private foundation status.*** These organizations are neither public nor private foundations.

***Exemption from federal income taxes.*** These organizations are exempt from federal income tax.

***Eligibility to receive tax-deductible charitable contributions.*** Some organizations in this category (501(c)(3) organizations) are eligible to receive tax-deductible charitable contributions, and others (501not3 organizations) are not. (See Appendix A for more details about 501(c)(3) vs. 501not3 organizations).

***Identification.*** We can identify organizations that are not foundations, trusts, or grant-making organizations using SUBSECCD (subsection code), LEVEL 1 (public charity or private foundation?) and NTEECC (NTEECC primary purpose). Values of not 90, 91, or 92 for SUBSECCD indicate that an organization is not a 4947(a)(1) charitable trust or a 4947(a)(2) split-interest charitable trust; values of not PF (private foundation) and not U (unknown) for LEVEL1 indicate that an organization is a not private foundation; and values of not T20, T21, T22, T23, T30, T31, T40, T50, T70, T90, T99, A11, B11, C11, D11, E11, F11, G11, H11, I11, J11, K11, L11, M11, N11, O11, P11, Q11, R11, S11, T11, U11, V11, W11, X11, Y11, A12, B12, C12, D12, E12, F12, G12, H12, I12, J12, K12, L12, M12, N12, O12, P12, Q12, R12, S12, T12, U12, V12, W12, X12, or Y12 for NTEECC indicate that an organization is not a general private foundation, private corporate foundation, private grantmaking foundation, private operating foundation, public foundation, community foundation, mobilizing social sector resources and support foundation, federated giving program, unclassified foundation, subsector-specific foundation, public single organization support organization, or public multi organization support organization.

## Mobilizing social sector resources and support non-foundation

***Description.*** Organizations in this category mobilize social sector resources and support (according to their NTEE codes), but they theoretically are not foundations. \[Note: See "Foundation/trust/grant-making organization status."\] They "encourage people to volunteer" or are "concerned with civil society, philanthropy, and the nonprofit sector" and "seek to promote the practice of charitable giving and voluntarism through a variety of strategies including, advocacy, disclosure, information exchange, and research."[^1]

[^1]: [@activity-codes]

***Foundation/trust/grant-making organization status.*** Theortically, organizations in this category are not foundations, trusts, or grant-making organizations. However, upon inspection, approximately 4/10 of these organizations are foundations or grant-making organizations, while the remaining 6/10 are not. It is not possible to determine which organizations are public foundations/grant-making organizations without examining each one individually. Therefore, for studies involving public foundations/grant-making organizations, this group warrants close inspection.

***Subsector.*** These organizations can be 501(c)(3) or 501not3 organizations. (See Appendix A for more details about 501(c)(3) vs. 501not3 organizations).

***Public or private foundation status.*** Some of these organizations are public foundations.

***Exemption from federal income taxes.*** These organizations are exempt from federal income tax.

***Eligibility to receive tax-deductible charitable contributions.*** Some organizations in this category (501(c)(3) organizations) are eligible to receive tax-deductible charitable contributions, and others (501not3 organizations) are not. (See Appendix A for more details about 501(c)(3) vs. 501not3 organizations).

***Identification.*** We can identify mobilizing social sector resources and support non-foundations using LEVEL 1 (public charity or private foundation?) and NTEECC (NTEECC primary purpose). Values of not PF (private foundation) and not U (unknown) for LEVEL1 indicate that an organization is a not private foundation, and values of T40 or T50 for NTEECC indicate that an organization promotes voluntarism, philanthropy, or charity.

## Private corporate foundation

***Description.*** Organizations in this category have 501(c)(3) private foundation status (from the IRS) and "corporate foundation" NTEE codes. Corporate foundations are "private foundations whose grant funds are derived primarily from the contributions of a profit-making business organization."[^2]

[^2]: [@activity-codes]

***Foundation/trust/grant-making organization status.*** Organizations in this category are foundations, trusts, or grant-making organizations.

***Subsector.*** These organizations are 501(c)(3) private foundations.

***Public or private foundation status.*** These organizations are private foundations.

***Exemption from federal income taxes.*** These organizations are exempt from federal income tax.

***Eligibility to receive tax-deductible charitable contributions.*** These organizations are eligible to receive tax-deductible charitable contributions.

***Identification.*** We can identify private corporate foundations using SUBSECCD (subsection code), LEVEL 1 (public charity or private foundation?) and NTEECC (NTEECC primary purpose). Values of 3 for SUBSECCD indicate that an organization is a 501(c)(3) organization; values of PF (private foundation) and not U (unknown) for LEVEL1 indicate that an organization is a private foundation; and values of T21 for NTEECC indicate that an organization is a corporate foundation.

## Private grantmaking foundation

***Description.*** Organizations in this category have 501(c)(3) private foundation status (from the IRS) and "private independent foundation" NTEE codes. Private independent foundations are "private foundations that make grants based on charitable endowments. Because of their endowments, they are focused primarily on grantmaking and generally do not actively raise funds or seek public financial support. These are the most common type of private foundation They are generally endowed, usually from a single individual or family. Private foundations are considered family foundations if relatives or the original donor are still active on the board of trustees or in the operation of the foundation."[^3]

[^25]: [@irs-exempt-purposes]

501(c)(3) organizations indicate which exempt purpose(s) they advance when they file Form 1023 or 1023-EZ to apply for recognition of exemption from federal income tax (aka "tax-exempt status") [@irs-2014b; @irs-2020a].

There are two major tax advantages to having 501(c)(3) status:

1.  501(c)(3) organizations are exempt from federal income tax; and
2.  They can receive tax-deductible charitable contributions [@irs-2018].

501(c)(3) organizations are either public charities or private foundations.

## Appendix B. 501(c)(3) public charities vs. 501(c)(3) private foundations

    -   Type II -- those supervised or controlled in connection with the supported organization(s) by having control or management of the supporting organization vested in the same persons that control or manage the supported organization(s)

501(c)(3) organizations indicate whether they are a public charity or a private foundation when they file Form 1023 or 1023-EZ, and if they are a public charity, they must select the reason they are not a private foundation [@irs-2014b; @irs-2020a]. 501(c)(3) public charities also select the reason they are not a private foundation when they file Schedule A (Form 990) every year [@irs-2022f]. Private foundations that later want to be reclassified as public charities must terminate their private foundation status and apply for public charity status.[^26]
